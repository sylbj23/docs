# Trade API

Our DEX API provides developers a set of APIs to identify the best quotes and execute the most efficient swap routes through our smart routing algorithm and liquidity aggregation across 500+ DEXs across Solana, EVM, SUI and more.

It provides the critical multi-chain DEX aggregator backend for developers to build and scale trading experience within a variety of dApps such as

- DEX Dashboards and Aggregators: offering users a comprehensive view of prices and liquidity across multiple decentralized exchanges for optimized trading.
- Native Swap in Wallets: enabling wallets to incorporate built-in swap functionalities with access to the best liquidity pools.
- Multi-chain Trading Bots: allowing automation of trading strategies such as arbitrage, liquidity mining, and asset management by leveraging high liquidity and efficient trade routing across 20+ chains.
- DeFi Lending Platforms: supporting Defi platforms with liquidity tracking for optimized asset management and lending strategies.
- Arbitrage Bots: providing tools and infrastructure to enable developers to perform and profit from price differences across multiple DEXs or between DEXs and CEXs.
